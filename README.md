# Verilog 8085 Microprocessor Implementation

This project is a complete Verilog HDL implementation of the Intel 8085 8-bit microprocessor. It is designed for educational purposes and supports a range of instructions covering data transfer, arithmetic, logic, and branching operations.

Built to simulate instruction-level execution, this design is modular and can be tested using Verilog simulation tools.

---

## Features Implemented

- Instruction fetch, decode, and execute stages
- Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
- General-purpose register file (registers A, B, C, D, E, H, L)
- Memory read/write support
- Branching and jump control logic
- Instruction decoder with support for register, immediate, and memory addressing
- Halt (HLT) instruction for stopping execution
